# Unofficial Fabula Ultima system for FoundryVTT

Manifest: [https://github.com/Shourn/foundryvtt-fabulaultima/main/system.json](https://github.com/Shourn/foundryvtt-fabulaultima/main/system.json)

## General Information (Read before playing)

This system is a work in progress and far from finished.

Until version 1.0 I won't make any promises regarding compatibility between version, use the system at your own risk.

That being said, a few things are already working, for example checks (including rerolling and pushing) and status effects and their influence on die size.

There is also a lot of stuff that's not yet implemented or does not work correctly.
If you feel a feature is missing or if you find something that is not working correctly, please open an issue.
